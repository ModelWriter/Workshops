# GitHub
###What is GitHub ?

* GitHub is a Web-based revision control hosting service for software development and code sharing.

* GitHub offers free public repositories and collaborations for open-source software creation and charges small and large businesses for private repositories and collaboration.

####Quick Introduction

* There are some important points on your profile page:

   * `Repositories:` Shows your repositories created by you.
   * `Contributions:` Repositories that you collaborate.
   * `Public activity:` Your all activities which is shown to your followers
   * `Organization:` Organizations which you have subscribed them.


**Issues :** Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.

* Once you’ve collected a lot of issues, you may find it hard to find the ones you care about. `Milestones`, `labels`, and `assignees` are great features to filter and categorize issues.

* **Milestones** are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. People use them in many different ways in software development.

* **Labels** are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

* Each issue can have an assignee — one person that’s responsible for moving the issue forward. **Assignees** are selected the same way milestones are, through the grey bar at the top of the issue.
