Pull Request
==========

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once the pull request is sent, your superiors or colleagues from development team can review your set of changes. They can accept or reject.  

###Types Of PRs

####1. Fork & Pull

>- fork the repository (copy project into your own repo)
>- make the fix or improve the codes
>- submit a *pull request* to the project owner

If the project owner likes your changes, he/she may pull your changes into the original project repository.


####2. Shared Repository
This model is more prevelant within small teams or organizations.

**Note:** Pull requests are especially useful in the fork & pull model because they provide a way to notify project maintainers about changes in your fork.

**IMPORTANT**: Example video will be added if requested.
